# Documentation of Virtual Pizza Robot

## Introduction
Welcome to the Virtual Pizza Robot project! 

Virtual Pizza Robot is an interactive Python program that allows users to create their own virtual pizza orders. It takes user inputs step by step to select the pizza type, size, toppings, and drinks. Additionally, it includes a fun discount quiz to make the experience more engaging.

## How This Machine Works
The Virtual Pizza Robot follows a structured flow to take orders and calculate the total cost. Below is a simple explanation of how it works:

1. **Start the Program:** The user is prompted to type "start" to begin ordering.
2. **Enter Name:** The program asks for the user's name and ensures it only contains alphabets.
3. **Select Pizza Type:** The user chooses between a vegetarian or non-vegetarian pizza.
4. **Choose Pizza Size:** The program offers three size options, each with a different price.
5. **Select Toppings:** The user must choose at least three toppings from a list of fun and unique options.
6. **Choose a Cold Drink:** The user selects a drink to go with the pizza.
7. **Calculate Total Price:** The program sums up the cost of the pizza, toppings, and drink.
8. **Discount Quiz:** A simple math question is asked to give the user a chance to win a discount.
9. **Apply Discount & Show Final Bill:** The program applies any discount earned and displays the final amount.
10. **Order Confirmation:** A friendly message is displayed confirming the order.

This beginner-friendly project helps users understand basic concepts of Python, such as loops, conditionals, and user input handling, in a fun and interactive way!
